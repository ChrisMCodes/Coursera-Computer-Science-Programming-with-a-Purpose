# Coursera-Computer-Science-Programming-with-a-Purpose
Assignments from the courses

This is a simple repository of all the solutions from Princeton's Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose course on Coursera.

The language used is Java. Its focus is equal parts theoretical and applied computing.

The course is free and I recommend it; however, I also recommend trying the assignments on your own before picking through this repo.

To be honest, I have no idea how optimized this code is. It will be fun to revisit it in the future.
